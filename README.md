Pharmacy Inventory System

This is my individual frontend development project (Year 1, Semester 2).  
The application is a simple inventory system for adding, editing, viewing, and deleting medicines.


 Objective

The goal of this assignment was to create a fully functional and user-friendly web application using only what we've learned so far. Requirements included:

Add new medicine entries
Display medicines in a table
Edit and update existing entries
Delete entries
Use localStorage  to persist data
Organize JavaScript using modules
stay within the design and logic taught in the course
